```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.align = "center")

```

# "The" Analytics Process

Many books, articles, and presentations use a conceptual diagram of the analytics workflow, which look mostly like this ([*Grolemund & Wickham 2017* ](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)):  

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 1.5}
knitr::include_graphics("data-science-process-wickham2017.png")
```

In reality, the analytics process is more like exploratory research, with advances and backtracks, restarts and dead-ends ([*Kandel et al. 2011*](http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2011-DataWrangling-IVJ.pdf)):  

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5}
knitr::include_graphics("analysis_process_kandeletal2011.png")
```

Exploratory data analysis includes not just an analysis of your data, but an assessment of data quality. We'll start there today.    

# Bivariate (and more) EDA

Let's load the packages we'll use today first:  

```{r}
library(psych)       # summary stats
library(tidyverse)   # gpplot, dplyr, and tidyr packages
library(forcats)     # factor manipulation for tidy data
library(scales)      # additional scales for ggplot axes
library(VIM)         # visualize missing data
library(beanplot)    # beanplots
library(ggExtra)     # marginal plots
library(vcd)         # mosaic plot matrix
library(GGally)      # scatter/bar/box/density plot matrix
library(pairsD3)     # interactive scatterplot matrix
```


We'll again use the Statistical Society of Canada's case study data we explored in Week 1.  

```{r dataload, cache = TRUE}
sbp = read.csv("https://ssc.ca/sites/ssc/files/archive/documents/case_studies/2003/documents/datafile.dat", header = T)
sbp = sbp[ , 1:18]
sbp[ , c(2:5, 9:12, 14:18)] = data.frame(apply(sbp[ , c(2:5, 9:12, 14:18)], 2, as.factor))
```

***  

## Data Quality Check

### Any missing, duplicate, or suspicious values?

For the purposes of this course, we started in week 1 with univariate data exploration to get quickly into analysis with R, but in reality you should do some basic quality checks of your data at the very start---specifically, explore missing data, duplicated rows, or suspicious values.  

We'll create a second data set from the original, and mess with it a little to show what this might look like. 

```{r}
# Create new data frame from actual data
bad_sbp = sbp

# Create about 15% NAs scattered around the new data frame
set.seed(54)
bad_sbp = as.data.frame(lapply(bad_sbp, function(cc) cc[sample(c(TRUE, NA), 
                prob = c(0.85, 0.15), size = length(cc), replace = TRUE) ]))

# Replace NAs with bad values in sbp and age
bad_sbp$sbp[is.na(bad_sbp$sbp)] = sample(8:20, sum(is.na(bad_sbp$sbp)), replace = TRUE)
bad_sbp$age[is.na(bad_sbp$age)] = sample(180:222, sum(is.na(bad_sbp$age)), replace = TRUE)

# Add a duplicate line (repeat row 72 on new row 501)
bad_sbp[501, ] = bad_sbp[72, ]
```

\  

The `multi.hist` function in the `psych` package is good for checking out whether a numeric variable has suspicious values.  

```{r fig.height = 2.4}
multi.hist(bad_sbp[ , sapply(bad_sbp, is.numeric)], ncol = 3, main = "")
```

\  

You can see unique values in a variable with the `unique` function; using it with `sort` can help you identify outliers/bad values.  

```{r}
sort(unique(bad_sbp$age))
```

\  

The `duplicated` function find duplicate rows for you. 

```{r}
bad_sbp[duplicated(bad_sbp), ]
```

\  

The `VIM` package has a simple way to visualize missing values (and relative values) across the entire data frame.  

```{r, fig.height = 6.5, fig.width = 8, cache = TRUE}
matrixplot(bad_sbp)
```

If your data is large and you often have missing values, the `VIM` package provides several missing-data visualization tools that are worth exploring further.  

We'll delete the messed-up data now so it doesn't get in our way.  

```{r}
rm(bad_sbp)
```

### Factors coded correctly?  

For both later visualization as well as to provide another example of a data quality check, we'll convert the existing categorical variables from numeric to actual values.   

```{r}
# Create more useful factors
sbp$Gender = as.factor(ifelse(sbp$gender == "F", "Female", "Male"))

sbp$Married = as.factor(ifelse(sbp$married == "N", "Unmarried", "Married"))

sbp$Smoke = as.factor(ifelse(sbp$smoke == "N", "Non-smoker", "Smoker"))

sbp$Exercise = ordered(ifelse(sbp$exercise == 1, "Low",
                        ifelse(sbp$exercise == 2, "Medium", "High")),
                        levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))

sbp$Overweight = ordered(ifelse(sbp$overwt == 1, "Normal",
                        ifelse(sbp$overwt == 2, "Overweight", "Obese")),
                        levels = c("Normal", "Overweight", "Obese"))

sbp$Alcohol = ordered(ifelse(sbp$alcohol == 1, "Low",
                        ifelse(sbp$alcohol == 2, "Medium", "High")),
                        levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))

sbp$Treatment_Group = as.factor(ifelse(sbp$trt == 0, "Control", "Treatment"))

sbp$Stress = ordered(ifelse(sbp$stress == 1, "Low",
                        ifelse(sbp$stress == 2, "Medium", "High")),
                        levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))

sbp$Salt = ordered(ifelse(sbp$salt == 1, "Low",
                        ifelse(sbp$salt == 2, "Medium", "High")),
                        levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))

sbp$Childbearing_Potential = as.factor(ifelse(sbp$chldbear == 1, "Male",
                        ifelse(sbp$chldbear == 2, "Able Female", "Unable Female")))

sbp$Income = ordered(ifelse(sbp$income == 1, "Low",
                        ifelse(sbp$income == 2, "Medium", "High")),
                        levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))

sbp$Education = ordered(ifelse(sbp$educatn == 1, "Low",
                        ifelse(sbp$educatn == 2, "Medium", "High")),
                        levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))
```


Rarely, factors don't convert like you'd expect (especially dates), so it's always worth double-checking to ensure that the original variable and the new variable line up exactly.  

```{r}
table(sbp$Gender, sbp$gender)
```

*** 

## Visualizing Bivariate Relationships

Having done some basic data quality checks (above) and some univariate EDA work (two weeks ago & earlier today), we can now explore our variables conditioned on other variables, i.e., bi-/multi- variate relationships. Usually, two or three dimensions (sometimes four) can be visualized with a single plot. Matrix plots provide additional ways to compare 1-4 dimensions across several variables.  

### Numeric/Categorical data

The plots in this section are for when you have a numeric variable (e.g., age) that you want to condition on a categorical variable (e.g., Treatment Group).

#### Comparative density plots

It's fairly difficult to overlay two histograms to get a comparative sense for the two (or more) groups, but density plots with a suitable alpha value can do so. Use the `fill` option to break the shading of the distributions into groups.  

```{r fig.height = 2.9}
# Not run (run to see why histograms don't work well for this)
# ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight, fill = Treatment_Group)) +
#  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5) 

# Comparative density plot
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight, fill = Treatment_Group)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) 
```

You can compare more than two groups, which is sometimes useful and sometimes not.  

```{r fig.height = 2.9}
# Comparative density plot
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight, fill = Exercise)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) 
```

#### Faceting

Facets break up your plots by a conditioning variable, so that each panel within the plot is a subset of the numeric variable.  

```{r fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 4}
# Faceted histograms+density plots
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), color = "gray80", binwidth = 10) +
  geom_density(color = "blue", fill = "blue", alpha = 0.2) +
  facet_wrap(~Exercise, ncol = 1) + # try ncol = 3 to see what happens
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank()) 
```

#### Facets and background data

You can also place each histogram (or density) on a background of the entire distribution of data. 

First, you need to create a second data set that *excludes* the categorical value you want to facet on.  

```{r}
# All data except your conditioning variable
second_sbp = sbp[ , -22]
```

Then you can plot that data set on a layer before the original data, so that it shows up behind those groups as an overall distribution.    

```{r fig.height = 2.5}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight, fill = Exercise)) +
  geom_histogram(data = second_sbp, fill = "gray", binwidth = 10) +
  geom_histogram(color = "gray", binwidth = 10) +
  facet_wrap(~ Exercise) +
  theme_bw()
```

\  

It could be done with density plots as well, if you prefer.  

```{r fig.height = 2.5}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight, fill = Exercise)) +
  geom_density(data = second_sbp, aes(y = ..density..), color = "gray70", fill = "gray70") +
  geom_density(color = "black", alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ Exercise) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank()) 
```

#### Boxplots

Boxplots are compact summaries of distributions, and were traditionally heavily used because they were easy to construct either on paper or with basic analytic tools like spreadsheets. Beanplots and violin plots provide a better sense of the conditional distributions, but boxplots remain popular, and can still be useful, especially in cases where you have a large number of categories you want to compare side-by-side. 

Note that we've now specified that the numeric variable is the *y*-axis and the categorical one is on the *x*-axis. We've also flipped the axes to promote an easier visual comparison across groups.   

```{r fig.height=2.5}
# Boxplot
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = Exercise, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  coord_flip()
```

```{r, fig.height = 4.25}
# Boxplot with an additional grouping
# The position_dodge width gives a little space between boxes
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = Exercise, y = weight, fill = Treatment_Group)) +
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(width = 0.85)) + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

#### Beanplots and violinplots

Bean and violin plots are more modern versions of the boxplot---essentially, you're plotting density curves in place of the box and whiskers, so it has the benefit of being compact, like a boxplot, but also provides a much better sense of the actual distribution.  

Violin plots are a density plot with a mirror image, so it has the flavor of a boxplot with the detail of a density plot. This is already built into `ggplot2` with the `geom_violin` function. You can add a boxplot to it, as shown below, or you can specify where you want quantile lines drawn using the `draw_quantiles` option (which we'll see a little later).  

```{r fig.height = 2.65}
# Violin plot
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = Exercise, y = weight)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "gray", trim = FALSE) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1) +
  theme_bw()
```

Violin plots can sometimes look like genitalia, so some use a beanplot instead, which is simply a one-sided violin plot. Since it works on `base` graphics, its creation is slightly more obscure in terms of options.   

A basic two-variable beanplot with a few options specified looks like this:  

```{r fig.height = 3.45}
# Basic beanplot
beanplot(weight ~ Exercise, data = sbp, what = c(0, 1, 1, 0), side = "first",
  innerborder = "black", xlab = "Exercise Level", ylab = "Weight", col = c("gray",
  "transparent", "transparent", "blue"), overallline = "median")
```

It's worth looking at the help file here, especially the `what` option:

```{r eval = FALSE}
?beanplot
```

There's probably no reason to use a beanplot for just a few categories; you could use a faceted density plot and get a nicer look (see below). However, beanplots can be useful if you have a lot of categories and/or you want to see the density *and* a side-by-side comparison (as you can with a boxplot), e.g., 

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 3.75, fig.width = 8}
set.seed(9)
bean_data = data.frame(Value = sample(c(50:120, 110:170), 1200, replace = TRUE), 
  Group = ordered(sample(month.abb, 1200, replace = TRUE), levels =
  format(ISOdate(2000, 1:12, 1), "%b")))

beanplot(Value ~ Group, data = bean_data, what = c(0, 1, 1, 0), side = "first",
         innerborder = "black", xlab = "", ylab = "", cex.axis = 0.7,
         col = c("gray", "transparent", "transparent", "blue"))
```

\  

As mentioned earlier, a comparison across a few categories could be accomplished more cleanly in `ggplot2` with a comparative density plot using facets, e.g.,  

```{r fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight, fill = Treatment_Group)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
  facet_wrap(~Exercise, ncol = 1) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank()) 
```

You can facet and/or condition violin plots as well; the latter approach, using the `trim` function, might provide a visual that's less of a "double-take" when viewed in a paper.  

```{r fig.height = 3.5}
# Violin plot
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = Exercise, y = weight, fill = Treatment_Group)) +
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), trim = TRUE) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

\  

#### Before/After comparions (*optional*)

A particular type of numeric/categorical comparisons is a before/after study. While all of the tools above can (and should) be used for that, there are a couple more visualizations that can be useful specifically for a pre/post-type of contrast.

We'll use the neurosurgery data from Week 2 for this section. 

```{r cache = TRUE}
neuro = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rmadillo/SCH_R_Training/master/Diff_Inf/Shurtleffetal2015_episurg_data.csv", header = TRUE)

neuro$Phase = ordered(neuro$Phase, levels = c("Pre", "Post"))
neuro$Duration = ordered(neuro$Duration, levels = c("Short", "Long"))
```

##### Dumbbell plot

A dumbbell plot is a lollipop plot with dots at both ends, to show change in a single category. This approach requires that the data are in the [wide format](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#spreading) to plot the start and finish *x* values.    

```{r}
# Spread FSIQ data from long to wide based on study Phase, order by Post score
fsiq = neuro %>%
  select(ID, Duration, Phase, FSIQ) %>%
  spread(Phase, FSIQ) %>%
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(as.factor(ID), Post))
```

```{r fig.height = 6.4}
# Dumbbell plot
# Color ramp from http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuPu&n=3
ggplot(fsiq) + 
  geom_rect(xmin = 85, xmax = 115, ymin = 0, ymax = Inf, color = "transparent", 
      fill = "gray95", alpha = 0.05) + # Normal IQ range (+/-1 sd)
  geom_segment(aes(y = name, yend = name, x = Pre, xend = Post, 
      color = "#e0ecf4"), size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = name, x = Post, color = "#8856a7"), size = 3.5) +
  geom_point(aes(y = name, x = Pre, color = "#9ebcda"), size = 2.5) +  
  labs(x = "FSIQ", y = "Patient ID (ordered by post-surgery FSIQ score)") +
  facet_wrap(~Duration, ncol = 1) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "", guide = "legend",
      values = c("#8856a7", "#9ebcda", "#e0ecf4"),
      labels = c("Post-surgery ", "Pre-surgery ", "Change")) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

##### Parallel coordinates 

Parallel coordinate plots can provide the same sort of comparison in a different way, and can add more levels than the two-level dumbbell plot, if needed.  

```{r, fig.height = 4.25}
# Parallel coordinates plot
# Grouping by ID makes the lines connect for each patient
# If Phase had >2 levels, you'd have >2 x-axis groups
ggplot(neuro, aes(Phase, FSIQ, group = ID, color = Duration)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.7) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape = Duration), alpha = 0.75, size = 4) + 
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#00BFC4", "#F8766D")) + # first 2 ggplot colors, reversed
  xlab("") +
  theme_bw() 
```

\  

***  

####  <span style="color:blue">__Exercise R1:__</span>
 
1. Create a comparative density plot of the `bmi` variable (body mass index), using `Smoke` as the conditioning variable.  
2. Add a `Treatment_Group` facet to the above plot.  
3. Create a boxplot of the `bmi` variable, using `Smoke` and `Treatment_Group` as the conditioning variables.  
4. (*Optional*) Swap the *x*-axis/fill assignments for `Smoke` and `Treatment_Group` to produce another boxplot to see what a change in conditioning does to the plot.  
 
***  

\newpage

### Numeric/Numeric data

#### Scatterplots

The classic plot for numeric/numeric comparisons is the scatterplot.  

```{r fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 3.75}
# Scatterplot
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight, y = sbp)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5.25}
# Scatterplot with grouping
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight, y = sbp, color = Treatment_Group)) +
  geom_point()
```


```{r fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5.25}
# Scatterplot with grouping, semi-transparent points, and loess trends
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight, y = sbp, color = Treatment_Group)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.75) +
  geom_smooth()
```

\  

Seeing marginal distributions on scatterplots can be informative, especially with time series data, e.g.,

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 2.5}
# Fake data
set.seed(3)
marginal_df = data.frame(x = seq(as.Date("2006-01-01"), by = "month", 
          length.out = 120), y = rgamma(120, shape = 3, rate = 0.8))

# Create plot object
example_marginal_plot = ggplot(marginal_df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  xlab("") +
  theme_bw()

# Marginal plot
ggMarginal(example_marginal_plot, margins = "y", type = "histogram", binwidth = 0.5)
```

\  

It's not as useful with our current working data set, but we can still see how it works.  

```{r fig.width = 3.8, fig.height = 3.6}
p1 = ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight, y = sbp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_bw() 

ggMarginal(p1, type = "histogram")
```

You can get *interior* densities or histograms on scatterplots, too...  

```{r fig.width = 3.75, fig.height = 3.5}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight, y = sbp)) +
  geom_point(color = "gray60") +
  geom_density_2d() +
  theme_bw() 
```

...which is the basic idea behind heatmaps (as you'll see in coming weeks):    

```{r fig.height = 3.75, fig.width = 4.25}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight, y = sbp)) +
  stat_bin2d(binwidth = 10) +
  geom_point(color="yellow", size = 0.25) +
  theme_bw() 
```

We can also use point size to add a fourth dimension to a scatterplot.  

```{r fig.height = 4}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight, y = sbp, color = Treatment_Group)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = bmi), alpha = 0.75) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(0.5, 3)) + # Change point size range
  geom_smooth()
```

Things can start getting messy when plotting four dimensions, and even moving into a 3d plot doesn't really help. Later in this course we'll cover dimension reduction to deal with this issue, so that we can adequately visualize multiple dimensions in ways that advance our understanding of the data.  

```{r eval = FALSE}
rgl::plot3d(sbp$weight, sbp$sbp, sbp$bmi, radius = as.numeric(sbp$married) * 2, 
      col = as.numeric(sbp$income) + 3, type = "s")
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rgl_3dscatter.png")
```


***  

####  <span style="color:blue">__Exercise R2:__</span>
 
1. Create a scatter plot of the `bmi` variable (body mass index) vs `height`, grouped by `Gender`. Include a loess smoother that is also colored by group.   
2. Create a "heatmap" scatterplot of `bmi` by `weight`, using the (arbitrary) binwidths of 2.75 for `height` and 5.3 for `bmi`.  

***  

\newpage  

### Categorical/Categorical data

#### Faceted barplots

Of course, you can facet with categorical variables as well.  

```{r fig.height = 3.25}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = Exercise)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ Treatment_Group, ncol = 1) + 
  coord_flip()
```

You can also provide a conditioning variable.  

```{r fig.height = 3.25}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = Exercise, fill = Alcohol)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ Treatment_Group, ncol = 1) + 
  coord_flip()
```  

#### Stacked bar/percentage charts

Occasionally you may be more interested in comparative proportions instead of counts. You can use `position = "fill"` to accomplish this.  

```{r fig.height = 2.75}
ggplot(sbp, aes(Income, fill = Treatment_Group)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  ylab("") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  coord_flip()
```

And you can combine them, as we saw above for regular bar charts.    

```{r fig.height = 3.75}
ggplot(sbp, aes(Income, fill = Alcohol)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  ylab("") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  facet_wrap(~ Treatment_Group, ncol = 1) +
  coord_flip()
```

The `likert` package has a neat way to summarize ordered factors, built on top of `ggplot2`:  

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8}
# Load package
library(likert)

# Create a likert object with variables with the same scale
sbp_likert = likert(items = sbp[ , c(22, 24, 26:27, 29:30), drop = FALSE], 
                    grouping = sbp$Treatment_Group)

# Plot the likert object
plot(sbp_likert, include.histogram = TRUE)
```

\newpage  

#### Mosaicplots

Mosaicplots are visual representations of contingency tables, so unlike bar plots, both *x* and *y* dimensions have meaning. There isn't a ggplot `geom_` for it, so we'll use the `mosaicplot` function built into R.    

```{r fig.height = 6.5, fig.width = 6}
mosaicplot(~ Treatment_Group + Income, data = sbp, main = "")
```

\  

Here is the data (as a cross-tab) for this mosaicplot, as counts (left) and proportions (right):  

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)
library(htmlTable)
tab = tableGrob(addmargins(table(sbp$Income, sbp$Treatment_Group)))
prop = tableGrob(txtRound(addmargins(prop.table(table(sbp$Income, sbp$Treatment_Group))), 2))

grid.arrange(tab, prop, ncol = 2)
```

You can add more variables, but after 3 or 4 the plot usually becomes too muddled to interpret easily.  

```{r fig.height = 5.3, fig.width=7.5}
mosaicplot(~ Treatment_Group + Income + Alcohol, data = sbp, main = "")
```

We can get a sense for whether a log-linear model would suggest independence/differences with the `shade = T` and `type = "deviance"` options (use `type = "pearson"` for $\chi^2$, ya know, if you're the kind of person who still likes to use the mirror reflector on your microscope ;-) ):  

```{r fig.height = 5.3, fig.width=7.75}
mosaicplot(~ Treatment_Group + Income + Alcohol, data = sbp, shade = T, 
           main = "", type = "deviance")
```

1. Create a percentage bar plot of the `Education` and `Gender` variables, using `Married` as a faceting variable.   
2. Create a mosaic plot of the `Education`, `Married`, and `race` variables.  
3. (*Optional*) Create a mosaic plot of the same variables, only moving `Education` from the first variable to the last variable in the formula. The visual will change, but does your interpretation of it change?

### Matrix plots

We often want to see a variety of cross-comparisons between our variables---matrix plots provide this view.  

#### Scatterplot matrix

You can use the `facet_grid` function in ggplot to show scatterplots faceted by two or more categorical variables.  

```{r fig.height = 4.3}
# Facet grid scatterplot matrix
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = weight, y = sbp, color = Treatment_Group)) +
  labs(x = "Weight", y = "Systolic Blood Pressure", color = "Treatment Group") +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(Gender ~ Stress) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

The `GGally` package provides a way to compare variables using density, histograms, scatter, box, and bar plots. The `ggscatmat` function works on numeric-only variables to show a scatterplot matrix with scatterplots on the lower side, densities on the diagonal, and correlations on the upper side (all by default; see the [`GGally` website](http://ggobi.github.io/ggally/index.html) for many more possibilities).  

```{r fig.height = 4.2}
# Subset for ease of plotting
sbp_numeric = sbp[ , c(1, 7:8, 13)]

# Scatterplot matrix
ggscatmat(sbp_numeric)
```

#### `ggpairs` matrix

The power of `GGally`'s `ggpairs` is in being able to compare a variety of different types of variables all at once. Using the `mapping` option allows you to provide ggplot-based aesthetics, or you can add custom functions to apply aesthetics to different plots.  

```{r fig.height = 6.5, cache = TRUE}
# Subset for ease of plotting
sbp_both = sbp[ , c(1, 7, 13, 22, 19, 25)]

# Not run
# ggpairs(sbp_both)

# Special functions to make density plots semi-transparent, but not other plots
# http://bit.ly/2meHiHh
my_dens <- function(data, mapping, ...) {
  ggplot(data = data, mapping = mapping) +
    geom_density(mapping = aes_string(fill = "Treatment_Group"), 
                 alpha = 0.7, color = NA) 
}
my_scat <- function(data, mapping, ...) {
  ggplot(data = data, mapping = mapping) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes_string(color = "Treatment_Group"), 
                 alpha = 0.4) 
}

# Most-of-the-above-plots matrix
ggpairs(sbp_both, columns = c(1:5), legend = 19, # use the 19th plot for the legend
    mapping = aes(color = Treatment_Group), # color by Treatment_Group
    lower = list(continuous = my_scat), # use custom function for scatterplots
    diag = list(continuous = my_dens), # use custom function for density plots
    upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size = 2))) + # change font size in cor plots
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 6), strip.text.y = element_text(size = 6),
    legend.position = "bottom")
```

#### A taste of interactivity

Where you need to brush (select) on one plot and see what happens on other plots, `pairsD3` is one option that's fairly simple to use.    

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Interactive scatterplot matrix
pairsD3(sbp_numeric, group=sbp$Treatment_Group, opacity = 0.7, 
        tooltip = paste("Treatment Group: ", sbp$Treatment_Group,
                        "<br>Exercise: ", sbp$Exercise,
                        "<br>Age: ", sbp$age))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pairsD3.png")
```

\  

#### Mosaic plot matrix

Categorical variables can be compared with the `pairs` function, once the `vcd` package is loaded.  

```{r eval = FALSE}
# For ease of plotting, we'll take a subset of the categorical variables
sbp_table = table(sbp[ , 22:25])

# Mosaic plot matrix
pairs(sbp_table, highlighting = 2)
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("vcd_pairs.png")
```

## Bivariate (conditional) Summary Stats

Deriving summary statistics by different types of groupings is a huge (and error-prone) pain in spreadsheets, but it's a breeze in R. 

### Numeric/categorical summaries

We used `describe` in the `psych` package for univariate stats in Week 1. Its wonderful `describeBy` function allows you to condition any quantitative variable by any categorical variable quite easily.  

```{r}
describeBy(sbp$weight, sbp$Treatment_Group)
```

\  

You can use more than one grouping variable by passing them to a list (which returns a list, so use `mat = TRUE` to have it returned as a matrix):  

```{r}
describeBy(sbp$weight, list(sbp$Treatment_Group, sbp$Income), mat = T, digits = 1)
```

\  

You can also show the results for all variables at once---but remember that if you don't specify that you only want the numeric variables' results, your categorical variables will also be returned (signified by `*`) and those summary statistics will be incorrect.  

```{r}
describeBy(sbp[ , sapply(sbp, is.numeric)], sbp$Treatment_Group)
```

\  

### Numeric/numeric summaries

Once again, `describeBy` helps us out. We can use hard-coded values to condition the summary stats:   

```{r}
describeBy(sbp$weight, sbp$sbp >= 140)
```

\  

We can also pass functions to allow for soft-coded values, such as by breaking the groups at the 80% percentile:  

```{r}
describeBy(sbp$weight, sbp$sbp >= quantile(sbp$sbp, probs = 0.80))
```

\  

And just as a reminder, it doesn't always have to have the ugly default R output:  

```{r}
kable_table = describeBy(sbp$weight, sbp$sbp >= quantile(sbp$sbp, probs = 0.80), 
                  mat = T, IQR = TRUE, skew = FALSE, quant = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
knitr::kable(kable_table, digits = 1, row.names = FALSE)
```

### Categorical/categorical summaries

The `xtabs` function is the workhorse here, which is easier to use with several variables than the `table` function. `ftable` flattens the result into a more nicely formatted table than the `xtabs` default:    

```{r}
# Not run because it's ugly
# xtabs(~ Income + Alcohol + Treatment_Group, data = sbp)

cross_tab = xtabs(~ Income + Alcohol + Treatment_Group, data = sbp)
ftable(cross_tab)
```

\  

You can wrap this with `addmargins` and `prop.table` as well:  

```{r}
# Wrapped in ftable to make it all one line
ftable(addmargins(prop.table(xtabs(~ Income + Alcohol + Treatment_Group, data = sbp))))
```

## Exercise and Homework Answers

**Exercise R1**  

1. Create a comparative density plot of the `bmi` variable (systolic blood pressure), using `Smoke` as the conditioning variable.  

```{r ex_r1_1_answer, include = FALSE}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = bmi, fill = Smoke)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) 
```

2. Add a `Treatment_Group` facet to the above plot.  

```{r ex_r1_2_answer, include = FALSE}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = bmi, fill = Smoke)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~Treatment_Group, ncol = 1)
```

3. Create a boxplot of the `bmi` variable, using `Smoke` and `Treatment_Group` as the conditioning variables.  

```{r ex_r1_3_answer, include = FALSE}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = Smoke, y = bmi, fill = Treatment_Group)) +
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(width = 0.85))
```

4. (*Optional*) Swap the *x*-axis/fill assignments for `Smoke` and `Treatment_Group` to produce another `bmi` boxplot to see what a change in conditioning does to the plot.  

```{r ex_r1_4_answer, include = FALSE}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = Smoke, y = bmi, fill = Treatment_Group)) +
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(width = 0.85))
```


**Exercise R2**  

1. Create a scatter plot of the `bmi` variable (body mass index) vs `height`, grouped by `Gender`. Include a loess smoother that is also colored by group.   

```{r ex_r2_1_answer, include = FALSE}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = height, y = bmi, color = Gender)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() 
```

2. Create a "heatmap" scatterplot of `bmi` by `weight`, using the (arbitrary) binwidths of 2.75 for `height` and 5.3 for `bmi`.  

```{r ex_r2_2_answer, include = FALSE}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = height, y = bmi)) +
  stat_bin2d(binwidth = c(2.75, 5.3)) +
  geom_point(color="yellow", size = 0.9) +
  theme_bw() 
```


**Exercise R3**  
 
1. Create a percentage bar plot of the `Education` and `Gender` variables, using `Married` as a faceting variable.  

```{r ex_R3_1_answer, include = FALSE}
ggplot(sbp, aes(x = Education, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  facet_wrap(~ Married, ncol = 2) + 
  ylab("") +
  coord_flip()
```

2. Create a mosaic plot of the `Education`, `Married`, and `race` variables.  

```{r ex_R3_2_answer, include = FALSE}
mosaicplot(~ Education + Married + race, data = sbp, main = "")
```

3. (*Optional*) Create a mosaic plot of the same variables, only moving `Education` from the first variable to the last variable in the formula. The visual will change---does your interpretation of it change?    

```{r ex_R3_3_answer, include = FALSE}
mosaicplot(~ Married + race + Education, data = sbp, main = "")
```
