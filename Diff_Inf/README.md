***Methods Abstract***

Cognitive outcome after focal surgical resection was retrospectively reviewed for 15 cognitively intact children operated on between 2 and 6 years of age for lesion-related, early-onset epilepsy. Wechsler intelligence tests were conducted prior to and after surgery to explore differences in intelligence between short versus long duration of seizures prior to surgical resection.

***Data Dictionary***

**ID**: identifier, Patient "ID" (ordered arbitrary number assignment; not linked to any actual patient identifiers).

**Duration**: factor, takes two values. *Short* refers to patients who had surgical resection within 6 months of initial diagnosis, while *Long* refers to patients who had surgery 18 months or more after initial diagnosis. The span of time between short and long groups is an artifact of the studyâ€™s population and was not pre-determined, as there were no patients who had surgery between 6 and 18 months from diagnosis.

**Side**: factor, takes two values. *Left* refers to surgery occurring on the left side of the brain, while *Right* refers to surgery on the right side of the brain. This factor is not used in this analysis.

**Phase**: factor, takes two values. *Pre* refers to the test before surgery. For *Post*, if a patient had two post-surgery tests, the Phase 3 scores were used for this variable. If a patient only had one post-surgery test, that score was used no matter which phase it occurred in.

**FSIQ**: integer. Full Scale IQ score based on the Wechsler test. The test is scaled to a mean of 100 with a standard deviation of 15.
