## The study: 

Cognitive outcome after focal surgical resection was retrospectively reviewed for 15 cognitively intact children operated on between 2 and 6 years of age for lesion-related, early-onset epilepsy. Wechsler intelligence tests were conducted prior to and after surgery to explore differences in intelligence between short versus long duration of seizures prior to surgical resection.

## The practical question:

<div class="centered"><span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; font-size: 175%; color:red">Does time from Dx to Tx matter?</span></div>

<br>  

Literature is mixed, partially due to heterogeneous subjects.   

This study focused on a more homogenous group than seen in other lit.   

A drawback to study group similarity was sample size: *n*=15 over a 15 year period.   


## The practical answer:

<div class="centered"><span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; font-size: 175%; color:red">Does time from Dx to Tx matter?</span></div>

<br>  

Probably.

"...shorter seizure duration prior to resection can result in improved cognitive outcome, suggesting that surgery for this population should occur sooner to help improve intelligence outcomes."


## Why we concluded this:

<div class="centered"><span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; font-size: 175%; color:red">Does time from Dx to Tx matter?</span></div> 

<br>  

"Patients who had surgery within 6 months of onset generally had better outcomes compared with patients who had longer duration from the onset of seizures prior to resection. 

While we did not detect statistically significant differences ... clinically important improvements for the short duration group occurred in both FSIQ and nonverbal scores; FSIQ and nonverbal scores improved by 13 and 14 points on average, respectively."
